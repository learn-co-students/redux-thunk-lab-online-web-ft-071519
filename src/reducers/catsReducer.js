/*
Build out the reducer. Add cases as you build.

The Reducer:
1. Sets the initial state of the app.
2. Is a function that uses switch statements to determine which block of code to activate. Its purpose and return values change the state/store of the app. Changes in state will cause a re-render and therefore update the browser window based on the information in state.

3.
